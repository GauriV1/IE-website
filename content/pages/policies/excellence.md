#### **2024-25 Inclusive Excellence Plan**

**November 2024**

-   **Prior to IE Team Meeting on December 18, 2024** read *From Equity Talk to Equity Walk: Expanding Practitioner Knowledge for Racial Justice in Higher Education* by Lindsey Malcom-Piqueux, Tia Brown McNair, Estela Bensimon


* * *

**Discussion Questions**

**Chapter 1: From Equity Talk to Equity Walk**

1.  Would you consider yourself to be a practitioner with an equity talk AND an equity walk? If yes, how? If no, why not?

2.  Equity-minded higher education professionals critically examine institutional policies, practices, and structures through a lens that questions why inequities exist. What are the inequities in your area, why do they exist, and how are you working to address them?

3.  The text defines equity-mindedness as “the mode of thinking exhibited by practitioners who are willing to assess their own racialized assumptions, to acknowledge their lack of knowledge in the history of race and racism, to take responsibility for the success of historically underserved and minoritized student groups, and to critically assess racialization in their own practices as educators and/or administrators.” What is one equity-minded practice that you have engaged in during the last six months? If none, what prevents you from engaging in equity-minded practices in your role at Whitman?

4.  Does the subject of race come up in your department/unit with any degree of frequency? In what way is the role of “whiteness” discussed?


**Chapter 2: Building an Equity-Minded Campus Culture**

1.  How do you define equity? In what ways is your definition similar/different from the definition provided in the text?

2.  Chapter two provided ten different obstacles to racial equity. Which one do you see operating most frequently at Whitman?

3.  Which of the ten obstacles to racial equity seemed most familiar to your own practice?


**Chapter 3: Using and Communicating Data as a Tool to Advance Equity**

1.  What equity data would be most useful in your area?

2.  How often do you review equity data?


**Chapter 4: Aligning Strategic Priorities and Building Institutional Capacity**

1.  In what ways might your office contribute to and/or be implicated in institutional climate data and/or learning outcomes?

2.  Are you familiar with the Principles of Inclusive Excellence advanced by the college? Have they informed your practice in any way? If yes, how? If no, why not?

3.  Was anything from your functional area featured in the first Inclusive Excellence Yearbook? What would be something from your area this year (current or upcoming semester) you could submit for the next Inclusive Excellence Yearbook?


**Chapter 5: Building Capacity for Equity-Mindedness among First-Generation Equity Practitioners**

1.  Do you believe racially minoritized students, staff and faculty are having a deficient experience at Whitman? Why or why not?

2.  What strategies, approaches or techniques do you use to build your own and/or your team's capacity and competencies as race-conscious, equity-minded higher education professionals?

**Email from Dr. Johnson, August 29, 2022**

“I shared a copy of the DEIA Maturity Matrix with all of you. The matrix provides a description of progressive levels of inclusive excellence in an office or area. Based on the National Assessment of Collegiate Campus Climates, the matrix attempts to capture how and what a unit/department/division is doing in terms of Racial Learning and Literacy, Mattering and Affirmation, Cross Racial Engagement, and several other categories related to inclusive excellence.

We will be rolling out this matrix across campus in the weeks and months ahead with the expectation that each unit willconduct a self-audit to assess where they are on the matrix and develop a plan for how they will work towards inclusiveexcellence. As the Division of Diversity and Inclusion, we will need to model the way. With that in mind, I am asking that each of you carve out some time (at least an hour) during the next two weeks to complete this survey. The survey is anonymous and allows you to provide your honest assessment of the conditions in our Division based on the DEIA Maturity Matrix. Please complete the survey by the start of business (8am) on Monday, September 12th. We will review and discuss the results at our Division meeting on September 14th.

Follow this link to the survey \[link has now expired\]

I have already shared a slide deck with all of you that provides clarification and/or definitions for the different terms used in the matrix that may be unfamiliar to some. You should be able to find that here. Also attached to this email is a digital version of the matrix. Please let me know if you have any questions about this process.”

Slide Deck - DEIA Maturity Matrix Terminology Review

**Email from Dr. Johnson, November 11, 2022**

“I want to thank you all for taking the time to complete the DEIA Maturity Matrix Survey. I used the feedback you allprovided to construct a plan that I believe can help move us towards inclusive excellence over the next year.

You will find the plan attached here *\[please see below\]* and I want you all to understand that you can hold me accountable for the items articulated in this plan.

Some of the items listed in the plan are for independent study, meaning you should carve out time in your work schedule to view an assigned video or complete a reading. I will send out reminders. For example, please view the antiracism learning and literacy video for November before the end of this month.

Other elements of the plan will involve more instruction and include discussion at future team meetings.

Everyone on the team will receive a copy of the book *Subtle Acts of Exclusion* at the start of 2023, and everything else that you will need for this plan over the next year should be accessible through links in the plan document.”

**Diversity and Inclusion Matrix Plan (Nov 2022-Nov 2023)**

**Mattering and Affirmation** - In the maturity matrix, Mattering and Affirmation is about countering marginalization. The emphasis is on making sure that folks (specifically folks of color) who are often not centered in the institutional culture, are made to feel that they matter. That people are interested and concerned with what folks of color think, want, and have to say. There is an emphasis here on the responsibility of white team members in particular to ensure that their colleagues of color feel seen, heard, and cared for in workplace settings. Intersectionality is also important here, recognizing the impact of multiple marginalized identities and how important it is to validate and affirm those who frequently encounter multiple dimensions of bias in the broader community.

Results from our survey indicated that our team is at the **Initiated** level. Commentary from team members included assertions that “identities are not regularly validated and affirmed” and that “more can be done to address intersectionality amongst team members.”

**Action Plan - Common Read -** [**Subtle Acts of Exclusion**](https://www.amazon.com/Subtle-Acts-Exclusion-Understand-Microaggressions/dp/1523087056)

**Cross Racial Engagement** - In the maturity matrix, Cross-Racial Engagement refers to the degree to which team members feel calm, empowered, open and encouraged when engaging across race or in conversations about race with each other. Do white team members express fragility or defensiveness when the topic of racism emerges? Do team members of color feel safe sharing their true thoughts and feelings about their racial reality within the team? Is there broad recognition of the complexity of racialization and how it informs lived experiences?

Results from our survey indicated that our team is at the **Desegregated** level. Commentary from team members included assertions that “there are times when uninterrogated privilege impacts interactions.”

**Action Plan - Race** [**IAT**](https://www.projectimplicit.net) **Completion and Tatum essay** [**Defining Racism: Can we talk**](https://augustana.edu/files/2020-10/Defining%20Racism%20-%20Can%20We%20Talk%20Tatum.pdf)**?**

**Racial Learning and Literacy** - In the maturity matrix, Racial Learning and Literacy refers to awareness of our own racial identity and understanding of other racial groups. Learning and Literacy is reflected in formal education about race and racial politics through coursework or other sources. It is also about the need for and commitment to ongoing and continuous study of perhaps the most vexing issue of our time. Do team members understand race and the consequences of racism? Do team members understand the difference between actions that are racist, non-racist, and antiracist?

Results from our survey indicated that our team is at the **Initiated** level. Commentary from team members included assertions that “ongoing learning of inclusive excellence is happening but not antiracism” and “it does not seem like all members of the team see this work as essential or important to their success.”

**Action Plan - D&I Racial Learning and Literacy Professional Development Video Series** Team members in the Division of Diversity and Inclusion will be expected to carve out time in each of the months listed below to view the following videos:

**Racial Stress and Bias Response** - In the maturity matrix, Racial Stress and Bias Response is about the impact of unit, institutional, regional and broader racial climates on team member well-being. The emphasis here is on how intergenerational and collective racial trauma contributes to how subtle acts, behaviors, or attitudes that are perceived as racially loaded are experienced by different team members and the way that racism and exposure to racial violence/trauma (in the news, on social media, or in day-to-day interactions) impact a team member’s well-being, bandwidth and performance. Is the workplace a source of racial battle fatigue or are professional colleagues seen as reliable sources of interpersonal support?

Results from our survey indicated that our team is at the Desegregated level. Commentary from some team members included assertions that “identity based harm is rare” or at least suspected to be rare. While others noted that past experiences of harm (microaggressions and such) may be contributing to a lingering lack of trust when engaging across difference.

**Action Plan - Read Subtle Acts of Exclusion, view** [**Ross**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=xw_720iQDss) **TED talk video, and read Finch essay** [**9 phrases**](https://everydayfeminism.com/2017/05/allies-say-this-instead-defensive/) **allies can say when called out instead of getting defensive.**

**Unit-Department-Division-Commitment** - In the maturity matrix, Unit/Division Commitment is about how committed to racial equity a department is in practice. The stages of advancement toward inclusive excellence are related to progression from complete inattention to the operation of race in unit outcomes, to a clear antiracist agenda that works to ensure that racism (externally and internally) is not impacting recruitment, retention, promotion or the leadership of a functional area. Are all the leaders in a department from the same racial background? Are recruitment/applicant pools lacking in racial/ethnic diversity? If there are people of color in leadership roles, do they add new and different perspectives or reinscribe dominant cultural values? Are minoritized voices sought out or able to contribute to decision making?

Results from our survey indicated that our team is at the **Not Started** level. Commentary from team members seemed to reflect some confusion about this item. Many rated the Division at the Integrated or Inclusive Excellence level, but open-ended responses mentioned inattention to data, lack of accountability structures, and a reference to increased access to the VP’s supervisor.

**Action Plan - View LEAD video:** [**Empowering and Elevating Marginalized Voices**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=Yd6WdETeZtw)

**Context Awareness and Community Engagement** - In the maturity matrix, Context Awareness and Community Engagement is related to a unit’s attention to racial equity issues in the local and broader community and its responsibility to both center the most impacted by racial injustice and to work to address systems of oppression. Context awareness would be unit-level knowledge of the major concerns of communities of color in the region and engagement is structured involvement in addressing the needs of communities of color in the area. Are communities of color in the region experiencing food insecurity? Is access to higher education a major concern for BIPOC communities in the area? In what way is the unit working to address or alleviate issues that are contributing to disparate outcomes and social misery?

Results from our survey indicated that our team is at the **Initiated** level. Commentary from team members indicated a sense of “individual engagement and awareness” with a perception that addressing local issues is seen by many “as outside the department’s scope of collective work.” One respondent noted that “The Division does not seem to be actively engaged with the community in any meaningful way.”

**Action Plan - Identify a team member to serve as a community liaison to research racial equity issues in the region and report back to the team during regular meetings with the goal of identifying a service action or activity we can collectively engage in to advance racial justice.**

**Email from Dr. Johnson, January 17, 2023**

“…I wanted to get us focused on our Division's Inclusive Excellence plan. As you may recall, we have a number of educational items listed in our plan. There is an educational video scheduled for your viewing each month. I would ask that everyone be sure to carve out time to view the January video in the next couple of weeks. **Additionally, with the visit of Kathy Obear to campus last week, I am adding this video to our plan and would ask that folks budget an hour of their time this week to watch** [**this video**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=youtu.be&v=AZkNr-ls1K4)**.** The video should give you a glimpse into the 10-hour training that many people from our community participated in last week with Dr. Obear. At our next team meeting we will spend a relatively small amount of time discussing content from the Nov, Dec, and Jan videos. Be sure to bring any notes or questions you had from those viewings.

At the beginning of February, we will begin reading the Subtle Acts of Exclusion book together. As a precursor to that reading, please read the 9 Phrases essay provided in the Division plan. Early in February, I will send out another email detailing which chapters from the SAE book we will be reading in February.

Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns related to the plan or the assignments.”

**Email from Dr. Johnson, January 30, 2023**

“Looking forward to coming together tomorrow for our team meeting. We will spend the first 30 minutes or so in discussion about the materials we've reviewed in our Matrix plan so far… As the plan indicates, we are viewing specific videos each month. We are also going to be doing a common read, Each of you should have received a copy of the Subtle Acts of Exclusion text. We will begin reading that book next month - February. Please budget time in your schedules over the next two weeks to read the Introduction and first three chapters of the text (pages 1-56) so we can discuss at our next team meeting on 2/14/23.

In March, we will read chapters 4-6 (pages 57-112).

We will finish the book in April, reading chapters 7-10 (pages 113-159).

We will also have monthly videos to view each of these months. I will provide additional instructions for the other items in the plan as we move forward.”
