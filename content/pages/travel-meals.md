#### Travel, Meals & Entertainment (TME)

TME (Travel, Meals & Entertainment), is a “throw-back” term from before the time of JP Morgan purchasing cards. Anyone who traveled, dined out, or rented a car would pay for these expenses up front - out of their own pocket - and then be reimbursed by the college by submitting TME paperwork. While the Business Office still processes “TMEs” on occasion, this is the exception and not the norm. For the most part, employees charge purchases to their JP Morgan Chase credit cards for airfare, car rentals, meals, and ground transportation. Credit cards are far easier to reconcile than reimbursement paperwork, for all involved.

#### Meals

Whether you’re arranging a casual working lunch with students or hosting a campus visitor at a local restaurant, it is important to remember how different ways of consuming food and/or planning events, call for different budget object codes:

**Local Meals** - Whether dining in or ordering to go, grabbing coffee or arranging pizza delivery, the object code will be _Local Meals 5703._

**On Campus Meals & Refreshments** - Consuming at Cleveland Commons or Reid Market as part of an event or program? The object code will be _Local Meals 5703._

**Dining On Campus** - Consuming at Cleveland Commons or Reid Market as part of an event or program? Please distribute Bon Appetit meal vouchers. The object code for these will be _Local Meals 5703._

**Grocery Items** - when purchasing food supplies from a local supermarket, farm stand, or box chain superstore, the object code for your purchases will be _Supplies 5700._

**Accommodations Elsewhere**

Out-of-town hotel rooms and other accommodations can be made utilizing your JPMC purchasing card. Please keep copies of your receipts for all charges, for credit card reconciliation purposes.

#### Travel & Transportation

**Airfare**

You can reserve air travel for yourself or campus visitors, utilizing your JPMC purchasing card. Please note that there are different object codes for Domestic Travel and Foreign Travel, so please consult the Business Office accordingly. Whitman College has an Alaska Airlines mileage account (Alaska Airlines [EasyBiz](https://easybiz.alaskaair.com)); please contact your Admin Support to request a user profile. When booking airfare, both the college earns miles and the employee earns miles personally. The college utilizes this mileage to provide airfare for Summer Fly-In participants.

**Fuel & Mileage**

Fueling a vehicle for work purposes is permitted if it is a rental car or a college-owned vehicle (object code 5702 ‘Vehicle Fuel Purchases’). Fuel reimbursement for a personal vehicle is prohibited. If you are driving your personal vehicle you will be reimbursed you for mileage according to the current rate. Mileage reimbursement covers both fuel costs and vehicle wear and tear. The annual Mileage Reimbursement Rate can fluctuate, and can be found [here](https://www.whitman.edu/business-office/staff-and-faculty-resources).

**Motor Pool Vehicles**

The College also maintains a motor pool of Turtle-Top Buses and Suburbans for Whitman College Business Use. To rent any motor pool vehicle with a capacity of ten passengers or more, the driver must be van-certified through the Environmental Health and Safety Office. For more details on Motor Pool Vehicles policies or to make a reservation contact [Facilities](https://www.whitman.edu/facilities-services).

-   [Enterprise Rent-A-Car](https://www.enterprise.com) - Whitman College also maintains a business account with Enterprise Rent-A-Car (located locally on 9th & Main in Walla Walla). For individuals with a college credit card, use the XZ45344 promotion code and directly pay for the business rental at the time it is reserved/rented. For renters that need to have an invoice sent to Whitman for payment please have them follow the below procedures when reserving a car online:

    2.  Enter Pick up/Return times

    3.  Input in the Corporate account number/promotion code for Whitman's direct bill invoice code, DB45014

    4.  After you select your vehicle, and input contact details you will be asked to confirm the trip is primarily for Whitman College Business.

    5.  Input the billing number for Whitman College, 16770398

    This will authorize Enterprise/National to send a bill to the College for the rental vehicle.

    Please only provide these codes to the individuals that will be using the rental vehicles and do not post them on websites or where the general public can have access to them. If you are having someone send an invoice to Whitman, and they are not a Whitman employee/student please notify Justin Rodegerdts, so he knows where the invoice should be sent when it arrives.

    These codes should continue to only be used for Whitman College business purposes.

#### Insurance & Liability

**Airfares and Flight Insurance**

If you are booking flights via [_Alaska Airlines Easybiz_](https://easybiz.alaskaair.com) (Whitman College’s corporate account with Alaska Airlines), trip protection is automatically included. Our Division policy is not to opt for trip insurance when booking with other airlines, as the majority of air travel these days is open to refund or credit. Trip insurance is simply an additional cost that isn’t typically worth the extra expense.

**Gound Transportation - Waivers**

If you are a driver or a passenger in a personal vehicle, you will need to complete this transportation waiver form prior to your departure. All personal vehicle drivers affirm that their driving record is clean, their vehicle is appropriately maintained, insured, and equipped to complete a 500 mile round trip journey. Liability waivers can be found here: [Driver](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1235nAl6frpD21ckuPW1i9xJR5No_iGt4/view?usp=sharing) | [Passenger](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1tbl1JKS2H1890vq1A8daHjneBpdm_K8O/view?usp=sharing)

**_These liability waivers go through Environmental Health and Safety; current Environmental Health and Safety Manager Kat McWhorter joined the institution in May 2023, and we are working with Kat on providing further clarification about these waivers. More to follow._**

**Ground Transportation - Auto Insurance ID Cards**

These are for use when Whitman staff and authorized individuals rent vehicles on behalf of the college. When renting a vehicle please ensure that this information is on hand, to show evidence of insurance coverage to the rental agency - and in the unfortunate event you are stopped by a law enforcement agency or in an accident. [Download cards here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1buygkk2h3FDj8ugiCc5nxEKyV--J3ulZ/view?usp=share_link) or click on adjacent image.

**_The auto insurance card does not need to be given to someone driving their personal car.If someone is driving their personal vehicle then their auto insurance is primary, not Whitman's - which is why we discourage people using their personal vehicles for business purposes._**
