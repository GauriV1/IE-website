**Utilize Your Card**

**Employee Credit Cards** – the college utilizes JP Morgan Chase credit cards for employee purchasing. In addition to “brick and mortar” purchases, online purchases are a good way to utilize this payment method. The Division has an Amazon Business account for staff to utilize, and individual online accounts can also be established for purchasing office supplies, groceries and other pantry items, and all manner of goods.

**Purchasing Limit** - Credit cards are issued to staff with a credit limit of $5,000.00 and a single transaction limit of $3,000.00. For support, please email any questions to [jpmorgan@whitman.edu](mailto:jpmorgan@whitman.edu). Please see [instructions for reconciling your monthly credit card charges](https://cyan-tangerine-w282.squarespace.com/cards).

**Important Purchasing “Red Flags”**

-   **Gift Cards** are considered taxable income. For gift cards given to Whitman community members: If you've given a gift card, gift certificate or cash card of any value to a student, staff or faculty member of Whitman College, please fill out this [gift card form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScyskt2PzWinC5uZGfTPgoBoge4g6Rp36fawtmwS2nv5luICw/viewform). For gift cards given to non-Whitman community members: Please fill out the form only if the gift card, gift certificate or cash card exceeds $75 per individual.

-   **Gifting** a non-cash gift (occasional flowers, fruit, books, etc.) to any individual must be reported if it exceeds $75 per individual.

-   **Alcohol** The Division for Diversity and Inclusion has a one-drink policy. TME guidelines specify: _Reimbursable expenses should be reasonable in the amount and directly related to official College business_. Federal funds (if they are at all supporting your trip/conference attendance) cannot be used to pay for alcohol.


**Obtain A Receipt**

Make sure you get an **itemized receipt** for each purchase that you make.

**Missing or lost receipts are not good**, and create additional work for everyone. A lost or missing receipt should be a rare occurrence, lest it places your status as an authorized credit card user in jeopardy. All completed missing receipt forms are sent to the Assistant Controller for further review.

Consider **capturing your receipt** (if it’s a paper receipt), by taking a photograph - and then save it as a PDF. If the receipt is emailed to you, save it as a PDF ([Go Full Screen](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gofullpage-full-page-scre/fdpohaocaechififmbbbbbknoalclacl?hl=en) is also a handy tool).

File all receipts so that they are readily available at the end of each month. Think ahead and name your documents well.

**Compile Your Receipts**

Compile your receipts in **date order**, ensuring that each receipt is legible and that the date of the purchase, the total purchase, and the last four digits of your credit card are clear.

-   Scan paper copies and save as PDFs

-   Save Email receipts as PDFs

-   Save photographs of receipts as PDFs

-   [Combine all PDF documents into one master document](/folio)


**Review Your Paperwork: Screen, Sum, and Stamp**

Review your receipts and transactions for accuracy (do they add up to the same amount?); if a tip has been added, that both tip amount and total amount are included. Do the math for the Business Office, don’t ask them to do it for you. “Stamp” each receipt or piece of paperwork with the requisite information (please see [Stamping Your Paperwork](/stamps)).
