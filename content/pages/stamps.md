### “Stamping” Your Credit Card Reconciliation Paperwork

Whitman College’s Business Office consists of a small team and follows a **decentralized** operations model. As a Division, we follow a similar model. Each team member is responsible for obtaining, recording, and maintaining their receipts and monthly purchases. In turn, we need to ensure that our paperwork is presented to our Business Office colleagues in a timely and seamless manner. The stamp tool in Adobe is one of the most useful and easy ways to add information to digital documentation, and below you will find the steps to utilize this simple and efficient process.

#### How to Stamp & Combine Receipts

**Step 1** Design your “stamp” in a Microsoft Word doc. What information do you need to capture? Sketch it out. Save the doc where it can be easily located for the next step.

**Step 2** Upload your stamp to Adobe Pro and use it to stamp your digital paperwork (particularly useful when preparing your folio of credit card receipts for end-of-month reconciliation).

**Step 3** Combine Your Receipts. Using the ‘Combine Files’ tool in Adobe Pro, merge multiple documents into one folio.

### Alternative Systems

Ultimately, the system that you choose to utilize to combine your paperwork is up to you. Not everyone is comfortable with a digital process. You are welcome to tape each receipt to an individual piece of 8.5”x11” and hand write the information onto each page, arrange those sheets of paper into the same order as charges appear on your statement and scan them all at once and then email them to your Admin Support. Whatever works for you, is entirely acceptable. The example above is but one way of doing things.
