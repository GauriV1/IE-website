### Paying A Student

-   #### The Student Pay Period

The student pay period is from the 9th of the month to the 8th of the following month. Student payday is on the 20th of the month. Students should enter their time each day they work during the month. Supervisors and students will have one business days after the 8th to complete timesheets.

-   #### Tracking Hours Worked (Employee)

Ask your student employee to utilize the [Student Time Tracker](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P9PgrxVh8_yQLMVUxaPyIBmjyrEH5H37YrTfGfeBajo/edit#gid=1674457298) template so that they can update hour totals and see the sum of their hours, in order to avoid hour violations. Students are not eligible for overtime.

-   #### Submitting Hours (Employee)

Hours are submitted via **Web Time Entry** on *MyWhitman*.

The following instructions on how students can submit hours, and supervisor’s can approve these hours - all via MyWhitman - can be found on the Business Office’s [Student Payroll Webpage](https://www.whitman.edu/business-office/staff-and-faculty-resources/student-payroll):

-   [Student Instructions](https://www.whitman.edu/documents/Offices/Business%20Office/2022/2022-student-web-%20timesheet-instructions.pdf)

-   [Supervisor Instruction](https://www.whitman.edu/documents/Offices/Business%20Office/2022/supervisor-web-timesheet-instructions-2022v2.pdf)

-   Supervisor Training Powerpoint


If a student does not have any hours to record, please have them record ‘0’ rather no entry at all. This saves the Business Office from having to email the student to confirm that that they didn’t have any hours to record, for state auditing purposes (per WA State Labor and Industries).

-   #### Approving Hours Worked (Supervisor)

The student pay period is from the 9th of the month to the 8th of the following month. Supervisors and students will have one business days after the 8th to complete timesheets. Student payday is on the 20th of the month.

#### Important Dates - Student Pay Period & Approving Student Hours

**The student pay period is from the 9th of the month to the 8th of the following month.** Student payday is on the 20th of the month.

-   If the 20th falls on a Saturday, payday would be the Friday before.

-   If the 20th falls on a Sunday, payday will be the following Monday.

-   Students should enter their time each day they work during the month.

-   Supervisors and students will have one business days after the 8th to complete timesheets.

-   The student has until 11:59pm one day after the pay period ends and the supervisor has until 11:59 pm two days after the pay period ends.

-   The “Complete Entry By” date is shown in the top right corner of the timesheet screen.


It is requested of supervisors to specify an earlier date that they expect students to submit their timesheets. This is done to ensure they have sufficient time to review the time worked and reject timesheets back to students for corrections, if necessary. Supervisors will communicate this earlier deadline to students.

**Will You Be On Vacation? Unplugged and Unreachable?**

Please include your Admin Support as a back-up approver, and let them know well in advance if you will need your student’s hours to be approved while you are out of the office.

#### Student Time Tracker

Students are encouraged to utilize this Student Time Sheet tracker to record hours and keep an eye on any overages.

The current system in place (Web Entry via MyWhitman), does not tally their hours for them automatically, so this spreadsheet (with formula therein), can help them to ensure that they’re not going over their allocated work hours.

This is a tool that you could provide to your student employee if they would like to utilize it; in addition to tracking their hours via this worksheet, they must officially record and submit them via MyWhitman for Supervisor approval each month.

Students may work up to 20 hours per week while classes are in session.

* * *

#### Zero Hours

It may be that your student employee has no hours to log for a pay period. Please encourage them to record ‘0’ via Web Entry, otherwise the Business Office will need to reach out to them for confirmation that they have no hours to submit. Entering ‘0’ will save the Business Office team time and effort in this regard.
